# 100-Python-Projects

In my quest to learn Python, I want to build 100 different projects, from small, fun apps to bigger, more useful ones.

I'll be posting each of these projects, their code and demo links below. Excited to see how it goes!

<h3>Project 1: Fantasy Book Title Generator</h3>
<h5>Description:</h5> A small app that will give you a random name for your fantasy book based on your favorite animal + season of the yeear.
